Data will be saved as numpy arrays (dimension = axis)

NODES 
nodes:		nodes = 	[node number][x, y]
displacements: 	node_dis = 	[node number][dx, dy, dphiz]




BEAMS
beams-nodes:	beam_nodes = 	[beam number][node number i, node number j]
properties:	beam_prop = 	[beam number][A, I, l, E, rho]
support:	beam_supp = 	[beam number][end][bn, bv, bm]

where b stands for bool, i,j are the two nodes, and n,v,m the corresponding forces



FORCES
ext forces:	f_ext = 	[node number][fx, fy, mz]
(external forces acting directly on the nodes)
int forces:	p_int =		[node number][fx, fy, mz]
(reaction of the nodes to the beams due to weight and maybe internal forces on the beam)



SYSTEM
The symmetrical stiffness matrix, the force and displacement vectors can be constructed
stiffn. matrix:	k_sys =		kn1, kv1, km1, kn2, kv2, km2, ...
displ. vector:	u_sys = 	...
The total force vector can be computed by rotation the 
force. vector:	f_sys = 	f_ext - p_int
	
Then the system can be solved for u_sys
